  <p>Pickles is a very playful and affectionate little kitten. She loves to play and cuddle.</p>
  <p>Taking you back to how I came to own Pickles, that's my pets name.Well, I am not really a fan of pets but something pulled me towards this adorable kitten 2 years ago.I found the kitten lost outside the Estate court where I live. With the assistance of the Estate's security team we embarked on searching for the owner of the lost kitten. After a long search, nobody showed up and that's how I ended up with the kitten naturally adopting the kitten.
  <h2>Tips On Taking care of a Kitten</h2>
  <div>
    <h3>Nutrition and Health</h3>
    <p>It is really important to feed your kitten with the proper food appropriate for their age and size. These meals should be balanced to ensure they are getting the right nutrients. Always consult with a veterinarian to advise on the right food for your kitten as well vaccination.</p>

    <h3>Litter Training</h3>
    <p>Litter training should be started as soon as possible to avoid messing everywhere. I trained the kitten by placing her in a litter basket after eating or waking up from a nap. This will make them get used to the routine however, consistency and patience is quite key here!</p>

    <h3>PlayTime</h3>
    <p>Try to provide as many toys as possible especially for a solo kitten. This is helpful for their playful nature even when you are not able to play with them. This is also good for their physical and mental development. <strong> Caution</strong> when choosing the right toys to avoid very small toys with sharp edges that may cause harm. Interactive toys may be a good option.</p>

<p>Pickles is very playful and jovial to be around something I wouldn't say when I first found the lost kitten. Right now we are so attached i would'nt bear to lose her!</p>
